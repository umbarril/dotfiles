## using hyprpm to install plugins
## see more plugins over here: https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins
## A LOT more: https://github.com/hyprland-community/awesome-hyprland#plugins
## notice that hyprpaper, hypridle, hyprlock AREN'T plugins, they are external tools (though they are from the hyprland manteiners)
## to see a list of enable plugins, run 'hyprpm list'
